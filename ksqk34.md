Interest of content
-------------------
-Very good
Content is good, mixed with frequent pictures for each topic.

Consistency and quality of visual presentation
-------------------
-Very poor
No dedicated stylesheet was used, nor was a web development framework used such
as Bootstrap leaving the overall page very bare. A framework was required in the task.

No index page was used which was required in the task.

Each word in every sentence begins with a capital letter and a lot of the sentences
don't make sense.

Pictures and headings have been used to break up the text which is good however
the pictures are all the same size which causes some to be stretched. The picture
for healthcare has also been re-used for engineering design.


Validity of HTML
-------------------
-Very very poor
the style sheet section wasn't a dedicated file and has some mistakes such
as the background-color variable was spelt wrong causing the page colour to not change.

the text color was changed from black to black.

the tag `<big>` was used which is no longer supported

tags `<part1> <part1.1> and <part2>` were used which don't exist in html.

metadata was used however it was setup as "fish" instead of "viewport" so won't work correctly

links were correctly used and images were too.

The lists were incorrect because `<li>` tags need to be wrapped in a `<ul>` tag.

Evidence of collaboration
-------------------
-Unacceptable
Only one member of the group of 2 people ever pushed any commits.
Only a single file was written and only the master branch was ever used.
3 commits were made, the first one at midnight before the due date.

No contribution from the other member.
