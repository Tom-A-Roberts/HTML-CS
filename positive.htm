Airline or railway or private cab, all reservations are done online due to this wonderful machine. Travel has become so much easier.

It is also used in scanning and diagnosing different disease. ECG, EEG, Ultrasounds and CT Scans etc. are also done using computerized system.
Some major fields of Health care in which computers are used are:</p>
			<li>Diagnostic System: Computers are used to collect data and identify the cause of illness.</li>
			<li>Lab-diagnostic System: All tests are done and reports are prepared using computers.</li>
			<li>Patient Monitoring System: Computers are used to check patientâ€™s signs for abnormality such as in Cardiac arrest, ECG etc.</li>
			<li>Pharma Information System: Computer checks drug-labels, expiry dates, harmful drugs side effect etc.</li>

		<h2>Engineering Design</h2>
			<img src="fish6.jpg" width="500" height="340">
			<p>Computers are also used in engineering purpose. CAD (Computer Aided Design) and CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing) are the two major areas in Engineering that provides creation and modification of engineering drawings. Some fields are:</p>
			<li>Structural Engineering: Requires Stress and strain analysis for design of ships, building, airplanes and other products.</li>
			<li>Industrial Engineering: Computer deals with design, implementation, and improvement of integrated systems of people, material and equipment.</li>
			<li>Architectural Engineering: Computers help in planning towns, designing buildings, determining a range of buildings on a site using both 2D and 3D drawings.</li>
